Self replicating math micro blogging.  This is non property software, meaning that the code is in Public Domain with no restrictions, but also meaning that there are no fixed user names, logins, passwords, domains, or servers.  It is based on an assumption of infinite free web servers.  

To install, create a new empty directory on a server where php works, then put the file replicator.php into it.  Navigate your browser to [your domain]/[name of subdirectory or path]/replicator.php, and wait a few seconds while the files all copy from github.  Click on the link that appears to get to the main page.  Enter text in the text input and hit enter/return to post.  Dollars signs enter math mode, format is the same as LaTeX, and is typeset using the mathjax.js javascript library(accessed via a CDN).  Technically this is html so you can use any html tag.  Use up and down arrows to load old posts into the input.  Click the edit button to edit the code.  From there click the edit link to edit the whole structure of the software, including the dna.txt file which is used for further replication.  

This is like a living thing.  It replicates and mutates, it is owned by no one and it interacts with many things.  Who knows where it will go.  Mutate it and replicate it.
